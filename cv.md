## About me

Since childhood I was interested in puzzles, construction toys, and electronic
devices. As a kid I tinkered with ZX Spectrum and even programmed simple games
for it. At the end of high school, I discovered Red Hat GNU/Linux distribution
and invested a lot of time learning and mastering it. At present, my primary
goal is to grow as a developer through mentorship and hopefully future work
opportunities. I'm very meticulous and attentive with my work. I'm not afraid
of hard problems, and enjoy solving them. I'm innately curious, and I like to
understand how things work "under the hood".
